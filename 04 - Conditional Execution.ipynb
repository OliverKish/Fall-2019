You can think of comparison operators as asking the question: Is it true that these values are related in this way? If the answer it no, the value of the statement is FALSE. If the answer is yes, the value of the statement is TRUE (true and false are reserved words in python).

      "source": "**Note:** Python is very strict about indentation. Though indentation refers to any leading white-space, it is a best practice to use tabs to indent your code. Indents are used to create levels of execution where consecutive lines at the same level of execution are executed together. Execution is broken when the interpreter encounters a line at a different level of indentation. So, when you create a conditional block of code, all of the code you want to execute if the condition is true must be indented to the same level. Because the two print statements are indented to the same level, Python interprets that to mean that you want both lines executed if the conditional statement is true.\n\nConsider the following examples. In the first example, the code **accidentally** produces the expected result. Only the first two print statements were executed because the conditaion expression is true. The third print statement executes because it is at the root level of execution. This is illustrated if we make the conditional expression false (second example). The final example produces an error because the third print statement is indented too far. Indents are only used for conditional statements, [loops](05%20-%20Iteration.ipynb), [functions](07%20-%20Functions.ipynb) or multi-line statements. For more information on indentation, see here: [Python Indentation Rules](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#indentation)"

You can also use ‘not’ to invert the value of a condition. In the second block of code, or conditions will execute if either condition is true (and if both are true). Therefore, the else block will only execute if both conditions are false (parentheses are not required, but they help me keep track of my comparisons. At times you will have multiple and/or conditions in the same if statement and parentheses ensure conditions are evaluated in the correct order).\n\n### AND statement\nThe AND operator links two conditional expressions and evalutes to true or false. Both conditions must be true for the code to execute. If either condition is false, python will execute the alternative block of code. See the examples below. Notice, that you can chain together multiple comparisons. If you have more than two comparisons, the order of operations come in to play such that comparisons in parentheses are executed first and other comparisons are evaluated consecutively."

This means that if we are hoping for a number, even if they give us what we want, we have to convert it from a string to a number. If they don’t give us what we want, the conversion step will raise an error as our application struggles to understand their response. Try blocks are used to suppress and handle these types of errors. Just as with if blocks, indented code blocks are executed only if the condition is met.
