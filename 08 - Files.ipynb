This limits the types of tasks our applications can handle. In this chapter we will learn how to use python to interface with external files. We will learn how to open files, read files line-by-line and write data to new or existing files. \n\n## Opening Files\nBecause python is an interpreted language, interfacing with the operating system is handled by the interpreter. Therefore, when files are ‘opened’ python requests a file handler that acts as a middleman between python and the file. If you think of it from an ownership perspective, python owns the commands in python and the operating system owns the files stored on the computer. Neither really understands how to interact with one-another, so a middleman is needed to translate python’s requests into directions the operating system understands. \n\nwith open('random_numbers.txt') as fileHandler: \n"

If your code crashes after you open the file, the file may be left open and may be corrupted. The with statement ensures that files are closed when the with block of code completes. For indentation purposes, code that needs access to the file handler should be indented one level beyond the indentation level of the with (just like conditional and iteration blocks).  \n\n## Reading files\nThere are several mechanisms for reading from files. The first, and probably easiest, is to treat the file handler as an iterable list where each iteration through the for loop produces the next line of text from the source file. The code below reads the text one line at a time and exits the for loop when there are no lines left to read. "
